	<h1>popover Api</h1>

	<p>The Popover API provides developers with a standard, consistent, flexible mechanism for displaying popover content
		on top of other page content. Popover content can be controlled either declaratively using HTML attributes, or via
		JavaScript.

	</p>

	<p>A very common pattern on the web is to show content over the top of other content, drawing the user's attention to
		specific important information or actions that need to be taken. This content can take several different names â€”
		overlays, popups, popovers, dialogs, etc. We will refer to them as popovers through the documentation. Generally
		speaking, these can be:</p>


	<ul>
		<li>modal, meaning that while a popover is being shown, the rest of the page is rendered non-interactive until the
			popover is actioned in some way (for example an important choice is made).

		</li>
		<li> non-modal, meaning that the rest of the page can be interacted with while the popover is being shown.</li>
	</ul>
	<button popovertarget="custom-popover">
		Open images in popover
	</button>

	<div id="custom-popover" popover>
